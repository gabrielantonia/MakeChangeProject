## Make Change Project
First project for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp... Probably the coolest program anyone has ever made.
## Overview
This technical tour de force is a fully functioning automated robotic change registering system. It accepts an input value for checkout price and prompts input of cash tendered. It takes the difference of these values and breaks them into the sensical monetary amounts to return to the customer. This fully automated system is spoof proof; It takes no lip and won't be tricked by smart mouth users.
## Technologies Used
* Java
* Eclipse
* Atom
* Git

## Lessons Learned
* Variety is the spice of life
* All good things come to those who wait
* Coding can be challenging && fun
* Much stronger grasp of operators, data types, looping, methods, imports, and few nifty tricks like pausing the program, clearing the screen on ASCII terminals and prompting user input in order to continue.
